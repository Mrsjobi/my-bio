        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> My name is Igbalajobi Adedamola and I live and work from Ibadan, Oyo Staye, Nigeria. I started my Tech Journey about four
            months ago and since then I have mastered basic HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I am also familiar with Git and Github. Prior to this,
            I have worked in both the banking industry (Customer service and Customer Satisfaction)and construction industry (Project management and market research analyst).
            I am a graduate of the university of Ibadan where I got mt Bsc in Psychology. I also have an MSc in Managerial Psychology from the 
            universitiy of Lagos, Akoka. I decided to go into tech after taking a 3 year break from working and I choose tech as my new career path
            because I want to be able to be a solution provider and problem solver. This is my passion and I am super excited to see where this Journey takes me.
            To know more about me, please connect with me on all my social media handles. I will also love to meet and know more about you.
